# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

This repository contains the final assignment for the **Coursera course: Tools for Data Science by IBM**.

## 📘 Assignment Overview

As part of this final assignment, we were tasked with creating a Jupyter Notebook titled `DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb`. The notebook covers various foundational topics in Data Science, including:

- Common programming languages used in Data Science
- Popular libraries and tools
- Arithmetic operations in Python
- Markdown formatting in Jupyter Notebooks

Each section includes markdown cells, code cells, and outputs to demonstrate an understanding of both programming concepts and notebook formatting.
